In a talk given on the Greenland Cruise conference on consciousness in 2014 Philip Goff describes two bitter pills which must, he argues, be swallowed by anyone who subscribes to ‘pure physicalism’, according to which “completed physics will give us one day the complete fundamental picture of reality” [4:19], an ontological view which Goff sees as the natural elongation of the weaker epistemological view that “we should look to and only to the physical sciences to tell us what fundamental reality is like” [2:55].

Those bitter pills are:

Fundamental entities lack an intrinsic nature. [7:43]
Consciousness can be accounted for in entirely causal terms. [11:05]
Goff argues that both of these are entailed by something he calls ‘dispositional essentialism’, which is in turn entailed by pure physicalism. Dispositional essentialism is the view according to which “there is nothing more to the nature of a fundamental property than what it disposes its bearer to do.” [6:40]

The thread Goff uses to link pure physicalism and dispositional essentialism is the oft-noted fact that all theories provided by the physical sciences, and all characterisations of the entities referred to in physical theories, are made in terms of dispositional properties. Physical theory doesn’t tell us what things are so much as what they do. (Goff gives the example of an electron: it is characterised as something having a certain mass and a certain charge, but those properties of mass and charge are themselves characterised in terms of what their bearers will do in the presence of other things.) And when it does tell us what something is, it does so by appealing to what other things do—heat is molecular motion, storms are systems of air currents moving in certain patterns, atoms are aggregates of quarks bonded to each other in various configurations, and so on. So if physical science can supply only theories concerning dispositions and relations, but nevertheless can supply a complete fundamental picture of reality (as the pure physicalist reckons), then it follows that a complete fundamental picture of reality will be purely dispositional in content.

Seeing that the second pill follows from this is just a matter of noting that a fundamental picture of reality should include everything that occurs in reality, including consciousness. Whether or not the pill really is bitter is, of course, subject to much dispute, and I will not get into it here (though I have done quite a lot recently—see here, here, here & here). Instead, in this post I shall talk a little about the first pill.

A thing’s instrinsic nature is what it is in and of itself, i.e. independently of how it relates to other things. Since dispositional properties concern a thing’s capacity to affect other things, dispositional properties are relational, i.e. extrinsic properties, and so dispositional essentialism certainly does entail that at the fundamental level there are no intrinsic natures, or, to put it another way, that insofar as there are any things with intrinsic properties, those properties are in some sense derivative of the extrinsic properties of other things (typically the things that constitute them).

(To clarify the terminology before things get messy: a relation holds of a certain number of things, called its arity. The relation ‘being greater than 7’ has arity 1, because it can only be applied to one thing (11 is greater than 7) whereas ‘being equal to’ has arity 2, because it is applied to two things (1+4 is equal to 2+3). An intrinsic property is just a relation with arity 1, and an extrinsic property is a relation with arity >1.)

Fair enough, but what’s wrong with this pill? By way of trying to convince his audience of its bitterness, Goff offers a few variations on a theme. He first points to a problem of regress in chains of analysis. Say we want to understand some property P. A successful analysis of P will have been reached when some other property Q (or properties—if so let Q be their conjunction) has been found which can be taken as defining P, i.e. such that the following holds:
