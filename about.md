I'm an artist currently studying for an MA at Goldsmiths College. This blog documents my work for a module in physical computing. It will contain posts on research, experiments, and project development.

This is just one part of my massively fragmented internet self--I can also be found on <a href="https://vimeo.com/user33006557">vimeo</a> (mostly containing graphics and audiovisual work made with openFrameworks), <a href="https://soundcloud.com/samludford">soundcloud</a> (my sounds), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samludford/">instagram</a> (assorted crusts and slimes), and my critical studies research blog <a href="https://bodies-without-organs.tumblr.com/">Bodies Without Organs</a>, which has more of a searing-white-wall-of-miniature-text vibe.
