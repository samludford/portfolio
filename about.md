I'm an artist working primarily with code. Currently I'm studying for an MA in Computational Art at Goldsmith's College in London, and much of what appears on this blog is coursework related.

Originally I studied mathematics at university, and later worked as a freelance mobile developer for tech agencies and start-ups. My arts practice began with electronic and experimental music. An introduction to visual art came through involvement with the Brighton music scene, where I often performed VJ sets at club nights.

Now I incorporate computational techniques to work in a range of media, including sound, image, video, animation and physical objects.
