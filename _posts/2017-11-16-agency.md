### Research question

<br/>

How can playing with autonomous algorithms unravel the concept and constructs of agency?

<!--break-->

<br/>

### Artifact description

<br />

Set of Raspberry Pi Computers running autonomous programs (Linux Daemons). The systems function to communicate with one another, for each other, on channels closed from observation and interaction in ways that have not been pre-determined by human agents.

<br />

### Milestones

<br/>

#### Implementation:
- aquire hardware
    - 2 Raspberry Pis
    - (including associated stuff to run)
    - basic presentation (clear plexi)
- setup base system(s)
    - install linux
    - install secondary packages
    - c support (?)
- write daemon
    - basic skeleton running
    - simple enhancement that does one task on terminal execution
    - log info to console
    - blink led
- daemon initiated by boot process
- daemon interaction with other daemons, whether on different machines/networks/authors/etc
- protocol for daemon interaction
- protocol enhancement for total removal of intentionality
- experimentation
    - rule based systems for decreasing predictability and control document process and overall project
    - text
    - photo
    - video

#### Ideation:

- alive (binary vs spectrum)
- objective systems based (agency)
- human attributed agency (weak vs strong agency)
- creating autonomous systems to unravel the concept and constructs of agency.

<br />

### Timeline

<br />

#### Implementation:

- 2017-11-24 : hardware aquired, setup, and daemon skeleton implemented     
- 2017-11-31 : determine 2 or 1 rpi, boot process initiated, daemon to daemon interaction
- 2017-12-08 : protocol for daemon to daemon interaction [across machines and network]

#### Ideation:

- 2017-11-24 : alive and objective agency research
- 2017-11-31 : concepts and constructs of human attributed agency
- 2017-12-08 : grasp on specific research aspect we're exploring
- 2017-12-08 or 2017-12-15 : complete presentation quality documentation and object installation
- 2017-12-18 : project submission
