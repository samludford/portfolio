Both the expansion of digital technologies and the commodification of human processes have led art to become ever more entwined with the market. This poses a challenge for art insofar as it is conceived as a form of politics, since it is its very independence from the market which underwrites its claim to offer a legitimate political critique.

In order to overcome these challenges the manner in which commodification operates must first be reconsidered in light of modern markets. Commodities are no longer things simply to be consumed, they are objects designed to transform the capacities of their users through their use. Productivity apps promise to enhance the output of those who pay the subscription fee; market insights increase company profits by providing them with better understanding of their customers’ behaviour. Market insights, as an example of big data, illustrate the dual aspects of the outlined challenge: big data and the algorithmic architectures that aggregate and process it not only commodify human processes, they do so via the use of digital technologies. These algorithmic objects will thus serve as an instructive example.

In order to rethink how art as politics may engage with such objects we may turn to Graham Harman’s general theory of objects. Harman has argued that while objects are distinct from their properties, it is through their properties that objects enter into relations with one another and in virtue of this how change becomes possible. More accurately, what we refer to as an object’s properties simply <i>are</i> its internal potentials to enter into relations with other objects, including those potentials inaccessible to human thought prior to their actualisation. That is, novelty is latent in objects regardless of how humans relate to them, and requires discovery. This is held in opposition to the view maintaining that novelty originates in human thought, requiring transmission from the originating subject to others via intermediate objects conceived as passive and malleable vehicles, devoid of potentiality in themselves.

Considering algorithmic architectures in light of Harman’s theory of objects, we must view them not only in terms of the purposes humans have created them for, but also in terms of the novel capacities they contain in themselves. Not only do financial derivatives serve to analyse statistical patterns in markets and thus provide traders with ways to optimise their activities, the deployment of these solutions in turn affects the market to be measured, creating feedback loops ultimately giving rise to new patterns of market activity impossible to predict from prior models.

This recognition of the autonomy of objects, given political urgency via the diffusion of digital technologies through the market, has displaced the privilege assigned by default to human subjectivity. In the context of this displacement art can only function as politics by engaging with objects in a way that recognises their autonomous capacity to produce novelty, and without imposing its own assumptions about what these new possibilities may be. Art must become a form of undirected play. Through play art may bring about the actualisation of potentialities contained in objects themselves, though it will not—cannot, even in principle—be aware of what those are before it sets out.

Furthermore, if art is to uncover to these new possibilities it must make no prior assumptions about where, in which territory or domain they are to be found. In other words, for art to function as politics it must become radically interdisciplinary.
