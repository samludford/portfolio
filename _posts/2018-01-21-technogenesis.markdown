In his work of speculative fiction The Princess Steel, written between 1908 and 1910, W. E. B. Du Bois envisages the ‘megascope’, a device capable of revealing material history via its trace in the present.

> You know we can see the great that is far by means of the telescope and the small that is near by means of the microscope. We can see the Far Great and the Near Small but not the Great Near. [1]

The Great Near is this material history---not only the structure of material conditions as they are now but the patterns of social relations that have driven and produced them.

In a survey of the topic, Reynaldo Anderson defines Afrofuturism 2.0 as

> the early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black Identity reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences, enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative sphere, with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an important Diasporic techno-cultural Pan African movement. [2]

Du Bois’ megascope is an early imagining of the mechanisms of such a technogenesis, a machine whose use reveals the hidden histories that have structured the present. Such a technology must out of necessity change the identities constituted by the perception of these histories.

The processes through which human interaction with technology change identities may work in destructive as well as constructive directions. N. Katherine Hayles describes how the circulation of ideas driven by developments in digital technologies informed her work on posthumanism:

> Posthumanism was in part about about the deconstruction of the liberal humanist subject and the attributes normally associated with it such as autonomy, free will, self determination and so forth. What I saw happening in the 1980s and 1990s was the rise of a new way of thinking about human beings that was in flat contradiction to all these attributes; that was what I called posthumanism.  One of its manifestations was the idea that if you capture the informational patterns of the human brain, you could then upload it to a computer and achieve effective immortality. [3]

Both du Bois’ megascope and earnest about mind uploading expose an important facet of technogenesis: a technology does not have to exist to have an impact on human identity. Sometimes it is enough that the limits of what technologies it is possible to imagine have changed, often spurred on by developments in scientific theory or more everyday technologies (computers in the case of uploading and, Anderson suggests, Einstein’s theory of special relativity in the case of the megascope).

A similar point is made by Len Manovich about 3D composition in the context of his theory of deep remixing:

> When the generations of young architects and architectural students started to work systematically with with 3D software such as Alias in the mid-1990s, the ability to directly manipulate a 3D shape (rather than dealing only with its projections as in traditional drafting) quickly led to a whole new language of complex non-rectangular shapes. In other words, designers working with the medium of 3D computer graphics started to imagine different things. [4]

Both artistic practices and identities are conditioned as much by what is imaginable as what is possible in actuality. This point highlights the role that technological change plays not only in defining the landscape of what can be done now, but what might be possible in the future. This role of technology is critical in constituting the way that we, as individuals and communities, conceive our own potentialities.
