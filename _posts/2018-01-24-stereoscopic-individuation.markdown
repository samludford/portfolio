Writing in Instrumental Vision, Rose Woodcock makes an intriguing point about the difference between perception of a picture and perception in stereo-immersive virtual reality:

> Pictorial possibilities [...] include stylistic, semantic, aesthetic, poetic, formal, physical and other aspects that vivify the pictorial art of various cultures. Importantly, these possibilities designate the capacity to see a picture as referring to something else […] In contrast, stereo-immersive VR gives the observer its world as a substitute, real-like world. [1]

A picture is a surface on which is a scene: a world within the world. And it is this presence as an object within the world that makes possible its representation of something else within the world. VR does something quite different: it discloses an entire world independently of its being embedded within the ‘real’ world. The distinction, illuminated by but not limited to VR, marks a fundamental difference in the epistemic modes of pictorial and ordinary perception. The former discloses an object within a world which may relate to others, the latter <i>assumes</i> a world which constitutes the condition of further disclosures.

Woodcock’s point is elucidated with reference to James J. Gibson’s earlier theories of vision. The perception of object as object—not as representation of object—depends crucially, according to Gibson, on a perceiver’s capacity to move around an object, so that they may extract from the multiplying disparate images the ‘invariant layout’ which is the true spatial structure of the environment. This extraction is an evolved feature of perceptual systems, occurring automatically, unconsciously, systems whose adaptation to 3D environments is already evidenced by the perception of depth created by the combining of two retinal images (one from each eye) with their minor differences in parallax.

The motif of novelty arising from disparity recalls Gilbert Simondon’s theory of ontogenesis. Elizabeth Grosz, considering Simondon’s description of how individuals arise from pre-individual processes, writes:

> The pre-individual is both individual and collective, both wave and corpuscle, both matter and energy, both form and matter, both space and time, both conceptual and material. It can be expressed equally though either term, though each then entails the other as its necessary milieu. Like the doubling of the image that constitutes stereoscopic vision, each image is the image of the other; but each is slightly different, askew, and it is their non-coincidence that produces the possibility of three-dimensional vision, of depth. [2]

There it is again: stereoscopic vision. The Simondonian point is that disparity is a precondition of novelty. In fact it drives the production of new individualities, the processes of creative synthesis which resolve the disparities that created them. The perceptual system solves the problem of disparity in retinal images by unifying them under a new percept: depth. Or in Gibson’s case, the multiplication of perspectives as a perceiver moves through an environment produce a sense of the invariant structure aka realness.

The metaphor of stereoscopic vision invites extension to other forms of seeing. In 1962 Wilfrid Sellars described two conflicting images of human in the world occupying contemporary thought: the ‘scientific image’, in which humans are seen as material aggregates of organs, cells, atoms, and subatomic particles bound by blind causal laws; and the ‘manifest’ image, in which humans are seen as beings furnished with intentions and purposes, desires and beliefs. The conflict in these images, Sellars held, provided much of the driving force behind philosophy, whose task was to form a stereoscopic synthesis of both without subsuming one under the other [3].

More recently, Nishat Awan has investigated how various kinds of digital seeing play roles in the construction of narratives about distant and inaccessible places:

> I am particularly interested in those places that have become more difficult to spend time in through conflict and war or that have been constructed as out-of-bounds by governments, state actors, and so on. Distance in this sense is not just about being located far away or being inaccessible, but it speaks of those places that through their material conditions repel us in some way, or from which we are repelled. Distance is here considered in a topological idiom, as resulting from a lack of relational connections that stretch topographical notions of nearness. Whereas in the past, such places would remain out-of-sight and out of our consciousness, increasingly they reveal themselves to us. Often this occurs through the use of digital technologies, from the impulse to map and create a digital globe of the whole world to the various social media platforms that transmit images and videos. [4]

Taking the Pakistani port town of Gwadar as a case study, Awat notes a disparity in its digital ‘image’ arising from its frequent citing as a place of strategic economic import combined with the highly restricted access granted by Pakistan’s army:

> Many of the issues just discussed coalesce in the Pakistani city of Gwadar, where bodies and materialities come together in unexpected and cruel ways in the wake of geopolitical manoeuvrings by states and other regional actors. On the one hand, Gwadar as place is almost entirely invisible to those outside the country; on the other, it could be described as being hypervisible. [4]

We might ask: what processes of synthesis might the disparities between the digital images of Gwadar—its hypervisibility and its invisibility—drive? Awat offers a clue:

> Whereas in the past, such places would remain out-of-sight and out of our consciousness, increasingly they reveal themselves to us. Often this occurs through the use of digital technologies, from the impulse to map and create a digital globe of the whole world to the various social media platforms that transmit images and videos. This situation is very different from the past when such places could only be seen in a few, select images that were often heavily mediated in reports by journalists and through the narrative of nongovernmental organizations and state actors. More than ever before, we are compelled to act, to somehow feel responsible for and bear witness to what occurs at a distance from us. [4]

What is this drive to action if not an attempt to respond to the eeriness of the presence of places—geopolitical places, yes, but also emotional places, speculative and liminal places—with no entrance point, of nodes inaccessible via paths in one’s own network? If the first stage of digital seeing is to become aware of these places then this first stage manifests as the weird awareness of absence, the perception of unreachable nodes. Surely the next stage will see the multiplication of images and hence the multiplication of disparities in images. Simondonian imperatives can’t help but follow. To be compelled to act is to be compelled to establish connections with these nodes, to send out exploratory tentacles to seek and grasp them, for better or ill.
