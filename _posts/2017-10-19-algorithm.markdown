Andrew Goffey not only urges us to resist a tradition which splits students of algorithms into those who encounter them in form and those who encounter them in content, a division corresponding to that between theoreticians (mostly mathematicians and computer scientists) on the one hand, and practitioners (mostly software developers) on the other, he draws an analogy between this and the semantics/syntax distinction in the study of natural language, an analogy which illuminates algorithms and points to a third way of understanding and engaging with them [1].

<!--break-->

This third way sidesteps characterisations formulated in terms of their formal structure or their concrete implementation details, both of which paint an inaccurate picture of algorithms as closed, self-sufficient systems. Instead it characterises them in terms of their pragmatics, appealing to the way they are used, their causal capacities, the way they operate on data and the way these operations affect and are affected by the wider social and historical context they occupy.

Goffey identifies Michel Foucault's concept of the <i>statement</i> as marking a departure from the conventional picture of natural language conditioned by the semantics/syntax distinction. According to Foucault, the statement is a linguistic primitive which can be identified with neither the proposition meant nor the sentence uttered or written [2].  

Statements cannot be propositions because the same proposition can be present where statements differ, for example when grammatical variations of a sentence expressing the same proposition function quite differently in literary contexts.

Foucault concedes that wherever there is a sentence there is a corresponding statement, but distinguishes statements from sentences on the grounds that there are many non-sentential items, such as tables, diagrams, and graphs, which we must count among statements. Given this, it is tempting to interpret Foucault as presenting the statement as a generalisation to all systems of signs of the strictly linguistic concept of a sentence. But this would miss the key quality of statements that Foucault elucidates elsewhere: they refer to specifically <i>functional</i> elements in discourses. Foucault might have distinguished statements from sentences in much the same way he distinguishes statements from propositions, by providing examples of sentences exhibiting multiple functions in different discursive contexts. The sentence “I miss you” expresses an emotion in a late night snapchat; in this paragraph it does not. The statement is the use, not the content communicated or the thing used.

Statements draw attention to the total discourse in which they operate, what lies beyond the semantic and syntactic features of the linguistic items they coincide with. This highlights the never exhausted capacity of such items to play novel roles when placed in new discursive contexts, a principle of openness standing in contrast to the closed systems implied by semantical and syntactical analyses. For example, Donald Davidson has argued that a metaphor functions not by conveying a special kind of meaning, but by conveying a literal meaning so obviously false that the recipient is unable to interpret it as making an assertion, and so is led, via an exploration of other roles it could be playing, to notice a similarity in the terms of the falsehood [3]. By subverting the proposition metaphors excite a process of discovery in their receivers.

In mustering this cluster of concepts Goffey encourages us to regard algorithms in the same spirit of openness, to recognise their capacity to perform new functions in new contexts. Included by accident in a release build, the debug feature becomes a security backdoor. Artists can exploit this openness by recontextualising algorithms in subversive ways, disrupting their normal use to foreground aspects of the discourses they inhabit which usually remain tacit.
