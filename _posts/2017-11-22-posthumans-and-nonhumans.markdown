Reading Richard Grusin’s introduction to The Nonhuman Turn, what struck me was a distinction he makes early on between the nonhuman and the posthuman:

> Unlike the posthuman turn with which it is often confused, the nonhuman turn does not make a claim about teleology or progress in which we begin with the human and see a transformation from the human to the posthuman, after or beyond the human.

He goes on to accept that work on the posthuman need not make teleological claims about the human progressing towards some final expression, state, or goal. But, Grusin notes, even drained of any traces of teleology the posthuman must, at the very least, be said to concern the transformation of what is now human into something which is not.

To an extent the nonhuman also deals with questions of identity. But where the posthuman concerns the persistence of human identity over time (or the failure of such persistance), the nonhuman concerns identities of composition and co-constitution:

> The nonhuman turn […] insists (to paraphrase Latour) that “we have never been human” but that the human has always coevolved, coexisted, or collaborated with the nonhuman—and that the human is characterized precisely by this indistinction from the nonhuman.

Humans are composed of nonhuman things like cells, organs, and thoughts, are embedded in nonhuman networks like ecosystems, coexist in interactions with other animals, viruses, moons, and trees. The air of paradox in the final phrase of this last quote pays heed to the notion that it is these very entanglements within networks comprised of both humans and nonhumans that constitute the human in the first place.

The posthuman orients thought towards our long term future, to the enticingly utopian space opera thematics of life extension, mind uploading, superintelligence. The nonhuman alerts us to the more proximal lessons of cyberpunk: we are situated in a world that we share with nonhuman entities and agencies with their own potentials and their own agendas---agendas which may or may not align with or be mouldable to our own.
