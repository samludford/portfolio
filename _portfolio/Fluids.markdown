Fluid Phase investigates the interaction of disharmonious cycles. Loosely suggested relations between rhythmic and timbral elements in the sonic domain and repetitions in the visual domain forms a synchresis constituted by an ever-changing pattern of mappings. As such, Fluid Phase is a study in the productive capacity of differences.

The audio for the piece was composed using singing bowls and modulated tremolo. The source material for the visual aspect was taken from old lectures in fluid mechanics.
