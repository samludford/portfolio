The performance was recorded at the The Verdict Jazz Caf√© during a gig organised by Beep, a Brighton based arts collective providing a platform for electronic and experimental musicians with an emphasis on live performance.

The set was partially improvised using an Ableton Push controller, and draws on elements from ambient music, drone, techno and Hindu mantra.
