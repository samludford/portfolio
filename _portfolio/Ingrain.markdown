Ingrain consists of eight pieces of ambient and experimental music made between 2011 and 2016.

Sounds were processed to tease out qualities and dynamics latent in the original material, then more or less allowed to dictate their own arrangement. Many are built around accidents that occurred while trying to achieve other things.

As much as was possible, things were just left alone.
