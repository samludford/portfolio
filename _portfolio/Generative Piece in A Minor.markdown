The piece uses an algorithmic process to generate rhythmic patterns used to trigger notes and intervals of an a minor chord, sampled from a classical guitar.

The process is based on rhythms generated by a variant of Euclid's division algorithm first described by <a href="https://ics-web.sns.ornl.gov/timing/Rep-Rate%20Tech%20Note.pdf">Bjorklund</a> in response to a practical problem in nuclear physics, and then shown to have musical applications by <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Egodfried/publications/banff.pdf">Touissant</a>.

The following is a seven minute exerpt from the piece, which could run on indefinitely. The Processing code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/samludford/euclid">github</a>.
