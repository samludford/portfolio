The piece uses an algorithmic process to generate rhythmic patterns which are used to play various notes and intervals of an a minor chord, sampled from a classical guitar.

The process is based around 'Euclidean' rhythms generated by an algorithm <a href="https://ics-web.sns.ornl.gov/timing/Rep-Rate%20Tech%20Note.pdf">first described by Bjorklund</a> in response to a practical problem in nuclear physics, and then <a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Egodfried/publications/banff.pdf">shown to have musical applications by Touissant</a>.

The following is a seven minute exerpt from the piece, which could run on indefinitely. The Processing code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/samludford/euclid">github</a>.
